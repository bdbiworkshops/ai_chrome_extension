<!-- 
  The script tag with type="module" is used to load JavaScript modules. 
  Modules are a way to organize and reuse code by splitting it into separate files. 
  When type="module" is specified, the browser treats the script as an ES module, which allows you to use import and export statements to include other modules.

  In this case, the script tag is loading the entry point for the React application located at "./src/popup/index.tsx". This file initializes the React app and renders it into the <div id="root"></div> element in the HTML.
